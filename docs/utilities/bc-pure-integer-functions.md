# Portable integer function experiment

Issue #598 extends #207's verified-execution work. The intended experiment is
a portable integer tier for hot pure functions, targeting call and recursion
traffic. No speedup or default-adoption claim is established. The execution
tier is not implemented in this foundation change.

## Number boundary

`Number::to_machine_integer()` returns an optional signed 64-bit value. It
rejects any nonzero declared scale, including `1.0` and fractional zero, rather
than silently changing the scale of intermediate bc arithmetic. It also rejects
magnitudes outside the signed range. Rejection does not emit a diagnostic,
detach a shared coefficient or modify the original value. Leading zero limbs
do not affect the guard, and every coefficient accumulation is checked before
the machine multiply/add.

`Number::from_machine_integer()` constructs the exact scale-zero value without
narrowing through the storage limb type. Unsigned magnitude arithmetic handles
the most negative signed value without signed overflow. Ordinary register and
array-index `to_unsigned()` semantics and diagnostics are unchanged.

Tests compare the boundary against independent decimal-text construction in
8-, 16- and 32-bit traits. They cover signed extrema, radix/limb boundaries,
values beyond both signed endpoints, shared heap and inline coefficients,
declared scales, and the complete integer range from -1024 through 1024.
Compiler/runtime validation uses hosted CI while a separate local benchmark is
running; a local diff check alone is not a build or execution result.

## Intended execution contract

The first execution tier must prove parameter/auto-only scalar state,
base-independent literals and exact scale-zero operations. It must preserve
lvalue timing, argument snapshots and function-generation ownership. Arrays,
special-register access, I/O, other callees and unsupported instructions retain
the existing interpreter path. Checked arithmetic, interrupt polling and
bounded preparation/continuation storage are required. Restarting after a guard
failure is permitted only while the purity proof guarantees no observable
effects and the incoming argument pack remains intact.

Keep the tier experimental until differential semantic tests, cold and warm
full/holdout measurements, and native Linux/macOS/Windows resource evidence
justify adoption. Preserve adverse and inconclusive classes; the overall #197
competitive requirements remain open.
