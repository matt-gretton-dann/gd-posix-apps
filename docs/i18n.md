# Internationalisation

The utilities are implemented in a way to encourage internationalisation of the output using the
POSIX specified `cat*()` functions.

## Infrastructure overview.

Each utility has a `utility.messages.json` file in its source directory.  This provides identifiers
for all the messages along with their translations.  See
[./file-formats/messages-json.md](./file-formats/messages-json.md) for more details of the format.

The build system takes this file to produce a `message-data.hh` file containing the necessary info
for the utility to access the messages, and the necessary message catalogues to be used at runtime.

See [/python-lib/generate-messages.py](../python-lib/generate-messages.py) for how this is managed.

## Adding new translations.

By default the `*.messages.json` file contains translations just for the "C" locale, which is the
POSIX locale, and we treat as being en_US, and using the POSIX mandated output formats where
required.

New translations can be added directly in this file, or through supplemental `*.messages.json`
files which add the appropriate strings.

Translations do not need to have 100% coverage to be useful.  For instance, the `en_GB` locale only
adds messages where spellings are different to the base C locale.

See [/python-lib/generate-messages.py](../python-lib/generate-messages.py) for useful utilities for
getting the translations for a particular locale, and general manipulation of the JSON.
